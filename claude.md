# Hoods Hookups - Development Guidelines

## Feature Development Rules

1. **Always make a feature branch** named `<name_of_feature>/features` and merge it before starting a new feature

2. **Keep the code DRY** - always read and search for related methods before composing them

3. **ALL NEW ENDPOINTS AND METHODS MUST HAVE ONE OR MORE TEST CASES** to validate functionality and **MUST NOT MOCK ANYTHING**

4. **Always git push on feature completion** and follow KISS coding principles (no spaghetti code)

5. **Keep commit messages detailed** and **MUST NOT WRITE UNNECESSARY MD FILES** for commits and new features

6. **Use Docker Compose to manage new services** - always ask permission before adding services like Redis, Celery, etc.

**ALWAYS FOLLOW THE RULES HERE**
